# Stat545 Assignment 4: Tidy Data and Joins

This is my submission for assignment 4 of the 2018 iteration of the Stat545 course at UBC.

The previous assignment we used dplyr and ggplot2 to approach specific data exploration and manipulation tasks. In this assignment, we move on to reshaping and joining datasets to prepare them for specific analyses.

Please refer to [tidyr-exercise.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-shreeramsenthi/blob/master/tidyr-exercise.md) for the exercise along with relevant code and figures.
